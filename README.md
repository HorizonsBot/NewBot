# Slack Bot Scheduler

### Built by Mohammad Syed, Yashvardhan Nevatia, Danhui Zhang, and Andrew Eells

Together we built a bot called Q. Q is built on the Slack Bot Platform and allows you to use natural language to schedule meetings 
with other members on your Slack channel. The meetings are pushed to Google Calendar and conflicts are accomodated for by providing suggested
available meeting slots.


### Technologies Used:

Slack API, Node.JS, Express, API.AI, Google Calendar API
